# Deep Water Mech

Deep Water Aquatic is a third-person action game where the player must destroy enemies to get parts to customize its mech and progress further. The game has a time limit, and the player must manage how much time they spend battling, collecting/equipping parts, and conducting repairs on the mech.

The game was developed as part of the Brackeys Game Jam 2023.2 where the theme was "Diving Deeper". As such we did an underwater game, where the player goes further into the ocean, borrowing a structure akin to the Bloody Palace in the Devil May Cry series.

Unfortunately, due to the ambitious nature of the game, we ended up with some bugs, and the game can only be played for one stage, as enemies spawn incorrectly in the following stages.
